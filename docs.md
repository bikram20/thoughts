# Google Summer of Docs for Ambassador

Having great documentation is critical to the product experience. Here is a list of project ideas:

* Write a HOWTO for deploying Ambassador with the Istio service mesh.
* Organize the Configuration documentation so that each option has the same format. For example, each option should have a description, some explanatory text, and an example. We're not consistent here.
* Automatically generate reference documentation from our protobuf API documentation.
* Interview some of our open source community users to identify the most pressing needs in the documentation, and work on a plan to address those issues.
* Write introductory text to each major section of the documentation, which is currently a table of contents.
